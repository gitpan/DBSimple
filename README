Here's some stuff you might need to know:

* there's no Makefile.PL. To use this stuff, either point a 'use lib' at
it or put it in your perl lib hierarchy somewhere

* it almost certainly uses constructs that didn't work before perl 5.003

* it includes several workarounds to avoid bugs that will be fixed in
perl 5.004

* these files are included:
    README                Some accompanying documentation
    DBSimple/DB.pm        Support for database objects
    DBSimple/Table.pm     Support for table objects
    DBSimple/Msql.pm      Msql v1 binding for databases and tables
    DBSimple/Msql2.pm     Msql v2 binding for databases and tables
    DBSimple/Field.pm     Support for field objects
    DBSimple/Type.pm      Support for field types

* if you're going to try to read the code, be aware that I use 4-space
tab stops. I've space-fixed this document to make life easier for you.

* numeric dates in the docs are UK-style: dd/mm/yy

* each module contains POD that may accurately and completely describe
it's use and operation

* almost all the docs worth reading are in DB.pm and Table.pm; the rest
is all under-the-hood stuff

* I'm not that well up on POD, so you may find some of my markup choices
infelicitous for the particular POD-reading mechanism you use. If so,
try this instead:
    perl -ne 'print if /^=head/ .. /^=cut/' DB.pm | more

All comments, suggestions, bugfixes etc appreciated, even ones about
my parentage (comments that is, not bugfixes).
